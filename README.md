# Spotify Playlist Analyzer Web API
---
This repo holds the code for running and testing the web API version of the spotify playlist analyzer code I originally wrote.

The purpose is to create a front end that can handle authprization, and all that is required is for one to ping this API with the access_token and username, and the routes can then be used to do anaylsis of the data - prefereably in the browser as the data is returned in JSON format...

... In Brief, this API is meant to act as a mediator between the front-end and the spotify API to properly format the data, and run any intermediate analysis required for the data.
